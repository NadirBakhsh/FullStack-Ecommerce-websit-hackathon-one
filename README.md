### Maintain code consistency
- Follow a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes. Use descriptive names that accurately reflect the purpose of the code element.
- Use consistent indentation and spacing. Use tabs or spaces consistently throughout your code, and make sure your code editor is set up to maintain this consistency automatically.
- Use a consistent code style. For example, if you're using JavaScript, you could follow the [AirBnB code style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) guide
- Keep functions and methods short and focused. Ideally, each function or method should do only one thing and do it well.
  Avoid using magic numbers or hard-coded values. Instead, use constants or variables to store values that are used more than once in your code.
- Use comments to explain your code, especially for complex or non-obvious code. However, avoid using comments to explain what the code does, as this should be clear from the code itself.
